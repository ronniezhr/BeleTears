Project: BeleTears

Introduction:

Feeling hurt by TeleBears? Fine, we've designed a new enroll/drop system
to stop your tears! The system works like a gambling game. Every student
has a certain amount of tokens(default to 1000) and he/she has to make a
bid for every course. The sum  of his/her bids cannot exceed 1000. After
everyone has  made bids for  the courses, the system  will automatically
enroll students  for each course.  For each course, we  basically choose
the students  who make the  highest bids(if  two students make  the same
bid, first  come first  enrolled). However,  students can  check whether
his/her bids ensure enrollment and drop  class or change bids as long as
he/she logs in again.

The files in this directory form a simple version of BeleTears system.
